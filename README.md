# Minecraft Treasure Finder

This webpage uses the fact that buried treasure only spawns at chunk coordinates [9, x, 9] to help the player dig in the right spot the first time. Just get as close as you can, type in your coordinates, and this tool will calculate the [9, x, 9] chunk coordinates of the chunk you are standing in. Just go to the calculated coordinates and dig until you find the treasure!
